This respository contains a decision-support toolkit for evaluating flood protection strategies along the IJssel River. This project applies exploratory modeling, scenario discovery, and multi-objective optimization to identify policies under deep uncertainty. The conducted analyses are mainly conducted using the EMA workbench.

# Project Overview

This project supports the Groot-Salland Water Board in identifying flood protection policies that perform well across a wide range of future scenarios. It combines open exploration, scenario discovery, and a directed search using evolutionary optimization.

Key features include:

- Simulations of river floods on different locations over a long period, with a wide range of uncertainties and possible policy levers
- Initial open explorations of experiments
- Scenario discovery using PRIM and dimensional stacking
- Sensitivity analysis of conducted experiments
- Robust optimization using a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MORO)
- Regret-based policy robustness analysis

Research conducted with the dike model and repository

The conducted research project with this repository consisted of a few general phases:
- (pre research: the simulation model was already created before)
- Specify problem formulation of interest in the problem_formulation.py. We made use of PF_2. This PF could reflect the objectives of Waterboard Groot Salland best.
- Create first experiment samples, using the Problem Formulations notebook.
- Conduct the Open Exploration analyses (initial exploration, scenario discovery consisting of PRIM and Dimensional stacking, feature scoring and Sobal Sensitivity Analysis)
- Conduct the MORO's (both mean-based and p90-based, both with two different seeds). This can take a long time/could be done using a super computer!
- Analyse and filter the MORO results, in the MORO_merge_and_filter notebook. This included pareto filtering, k-means clustering and creating new experiments with more scenarios.
- Conduct a robustness analysis with the saved policy set. Hereby, mean- and max-regret analyses were conducted.
- A second round of scenario discovery using PRIMA, based on the experiments created in the MORO_merge_and_filter notebook.
